Applying Logic Tensor Networks in Conceptual Spaces

Logic Tensor Networks ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04422), [Code](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/502aq9u537lrmbv/AABuiKT4cKN-P3J7RIXd3cQ9a?dl=0)) provide a way of connecting logical rules with a feature space representation.

In this repository, we use LTNs to learn concepts in a conceptual space.
